**> Please describe your current position and research interests.**  

Elizabeth Ligon Bjork: I am Professor of Psychology and Immediate-Past Chair of the University of California, Los Angeles, Academic Senate. My research interests have included visual attention and developmental processes but now focus on practical and theoretical issues in human memory and learning, particularly the role that inhibitory processes play in an efficient memory system.


Robert A. Bjork: I am Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research focuses on human learning and memory and on the implications of the science of learning for instruction and training.


**> 请描述您当前的职位和研究领域/方向。**

伊丽莎白·里根·比约克（Elizabeth Ligon Bjork）：我是一名心理学教授也是加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校前任学术委员会主席。我的研究领域包括视觉注意力和进化过程，但现在专注于人类记忆和学习中的实践和理论问题，特别是抑制过程在有效记忆系统中的作用。


罗伯特·比约克（Robert A. Bjork）：我是加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校特聘教授和心理系主任。我的研究重点是人类的学习和记忆，以及科学的学习对教学的潜在影响。

**> How did you get interested in studying the facilitating effect of apparent impediments to learning?**

Elizabeth Bjork: My interests in optimizing learning were triggered by interactions with students lamenting during office hours how hard they had studied, only then to perform poorly on a just-given exam. This motivated me to examine why students’ study activities were sometimes so ineffective.

Robert Bjork: My interests go back to my efforts—as a graduate student— to understand the relationship of forgetting and learning, especially why inducing forgetting often enhances subsequent learning. My interests in the application of “desirable difficulties” were fanned by my experiences teaching and coaching and from what I learned as Chair of the National Research Council Committee on Techniques for the Enhancement of Human Performance (1988–1994).



**>你们是如何对研究「表面障碍对学习的促进作用」感兴趣的？**

伊丽莎白·比约克（Elizabeth Bjork）：我对优化学习感兴趣是在工作中受学生们的影响，他们只有在刚考完试成绩不佳的时候，常会哀叹自己的努力。这促使我去研究为什么学生的学习活动有时候效率低下。

罗伯特·比约克（Robert Bjork）：我的研究兴趣始于我作为一名研究生的时候，努力弄明白学习与遗忘的关系，特别是为什么遗忘往往会增强后续的学习。我对应用“必要难度”的兴趣日益增加是源于我作为一名教师、辅导员，以及国家技术研究委员会主席的经历（1988-1994年）。



**> What has been the real-world impact of this work?**

Overall, the impact has been slight. There are multiple indications, however, that the impact of basic research findings on educational practices is increasing and that, in particular, optimizing instruction will require unintuitive innovations in how the conditions of instruction are structured.

**这项工作对现实社会的影响是什么？**

总体而言，这种影响一直被轻视了。然而，有多种迹象表明，基础研究结果对教育实践的影响与日俱增，特别是优化教学将需要在教学条件如何结构化方面进行直观的创新。

As teachers—and learners—the two of us have had both a professional and personal interest in identifying the activities that make learning most effective and efficient. What we have discovered, broadly, across our careers in research, is that optimizing learning and instruction often requires going against one’s intuitions, deviating from standard instructional practices, and managing one’s own learning activities in new ways. Somewhat surprisingly, the trials and errors of everyday living and learning do not seem to result in the development of an accurate mental model of the self as learner or an appreciation of the activities that do and do not foster learning.

作为教师和学者，我们两个人都从专业和个人兴趣来识别使学习行之有效的方法。通过我俩的研究，我们发现大体上，优化学习和教学往往需要违背自己的直觉，偏离标准教学实践，并以新的方式管理自己的学习活动。有点令人惊讶的是，日常生活和学习的经验教训并不能提升学习者个体精确的心智模式水平，也不能提升对是否能够促进学习的方式方法的鉴别能力。



The basic problem learners confront is that we can easily be misled as to whether we are learning effectively and have or have not achieved a level of learning and comprehension that will support our subsequent access to information or skills we are trying to learn. We can be misled by our subjective impressions. Rereading a chapter a second time, for example, can provide a sense of familiarity or perceptual fluency that we interpret as understanding or comprehension, but may actually be a product of low-level perceptual priming. Similarly, information coming readily to mind can be interpreted as evidence of learning, but could instead be a product of cues that are present in the study situation, but that are unlikely to be present at a later time. We can also be misled by our current performance. Conditions of learning that make performance improve rapidly often fail to support long-term retention and transfer, whereas conditions that create challenges and slow the rate of apparent learning often optimize long-term retention and transfer.


学习者必须要面对的一个基本问题即他们对是否在进行有效学习，是否达到了一定学习和领悟的水平从而支撑后续其他知识和技能的学习感到迷惑。

我们会被主观印象所误导。例如，一个章节将其重读一遍即可很容易地提高学习者对它的熟悉性或知觉流畅性，而学习者往往会将这种熟悉性或流畅性看作是“理解”或“领会”。事实上，相对于真正掌握，重读一遍带来的仅是低水平的知觉启动。

然而也可理解为那不过是学习过程中呈现的暗示，以后并不一定能重现。我们也可能被我们目前的表现所误导。虽然目前表现提升迅速，但往往这种情况并不能长久的保持和转化知识，而创造挑战和减缓表现学习速度的条件往往能够最优化这种效果。


### Learning versus Performance

### 学习与表现


This apparent paradox is a new twist on an old and time-honored distinction in psychology—namely, the distinction between learning and performance. Performance is what we can observe and measure during instruction or training. Learning—that is, the more or less permanent change in knowledge or understanding that is the target of instruction—is something we must try to infer, and current performance can be a highly unreliable index of whether learning has occurred.

这二者关系的悖论是一直存在的，他们之间如何辨别是心理学上一个新症结。表现是在教学中可以直接观察和衡量的，学习更多的是知识和理解能力的永久改变，是我们教学的目的所在，学习是否发生必须依靠我们去推断，而表现则是进行这种推断的可靠论据。


**Learning Without Performance and Performance Without Learning**

**没有表现的学习和没有学习的表现**

Decades ago, learning theorists were forced to distinguish between learning and performance because experiments revealed that considerable learning could happen across a period when no change was apparent in performance. In latent-learning experiments with animals, for example, periods of free exploration of a maze, during which the animal’s behavior seemed aimless, were shown—once reward was introduced—to have produced considerable learning. Similarly, in research on motor skills, investigators found that learning continued across trials during which the build-up of fatigue suppressed performance.

几十年前，学习理论家被迫区分学习和表现，因为实验显示，在一段时间内可能会发生相当多的学习，而在表现中没有任何变化。在动物的潜在学习实验中，例如，在自由探索迷宫的时期，在此期间，动物的行为看起来毫无目的，表明--一旦引入奖励--产生了大量的学习。同样的，在研究运动技能方面，调查人员发现，在持续不断学习的实验中，疲劳的积聚抑制了外在表现的发生。


More recently, a variety of experiments—some of which we summarize below—have demonstrated that the converse is true as well: Namely, substantial improvements in performance across practice or training sessions can occur without significant learning (as revealed after a delay or in another context). To the extent, therefore, that people interpret current performance as a valid measure of learning, they become susceptible to misassessing whether learning has or has not occurred.

最近的种种实验（部分实验将在下文概述）也已经证实了这种转换是真实存在的：即使没有显著的学习，外在表现的巨大进步也是能够通过训练和实践产生的（该观点暂且不表，择篇再论）。因此，某种程度上也可以说那些将外在表现作为衡量学习是否发生的人们，进行错误评估的几率更高。

**Storage Strength Versus Retrieval Strength**
**存储优势与提取优势**

At a theoretical level, we (Bjork & Bjork, 1992) distinguish between the storage strength and the retrieval strength of information or skills stored in memory. 
Storage strength reflects how entrenched or interasso-ciated a memory representation is with related knowledge and skills, whereas retrieval strength reflects the current activation or accessibility of that representation and is heavily influenced by factors such as situational cues and recency of study or exposure.Importantly, we assume that current performance is entirely a function of current retrieval strength, but that storage strength acts to retard the loss(forgetting)and enhance the gain (relearning) of retrieval strength.The key idea for present purposes is that conditions that most rapidly increase retrieval strength differ from the conditions that maximize the gain of storage strength. 
In other words, if learners interpret current retrieval strength as storage strength, they become susceptible to preferring poorer conditions of learning to better conditions of learning.

在理论层面上，我们（Bjork＆Bjork，1992）将储存在记忆中的信息或技能区分为存储优势和提取优势。存储优势是指某一记忆表征与相关知识和技能的巩固程度或内部联系程度，然而提取优势指记忆表征的当下激活程度或可及性，它主要受场景线索和新近所学内容的影响。重点的是，我们假设提取优势与个体在学习阶段的当下表现呈正比例关系，而存储优势的作用则在于防止（遗忘）和促进知识保存。当前目的的关键在于，可迅速提高提取优势的学习情境与可使储存优势增大的学习情境是不同的。换句话说，如果学习者将学习过程中的提取优势当作是存储优势，他们就可能会倾向于选择相对低效的学习方式。
