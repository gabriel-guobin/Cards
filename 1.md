**> Please describe your current position and research interests.**  

Elizabeth Ligon Bjork: I am Professor of Psychology and Immediate-Past Chair of the University of California, Los Angeles, Academic Senate. My research interests have included visual attention and developmental processes but now focus on practical and theoretical issues in human memory and learning, particularly the role that inhibitory processes play in an efficient memory system.


Robert A. Bjork: I am Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research focuses on human learning and memory and on the implications of the science of learning for instruction and training.


**> 请描述您当前的职位和研究兴趣。**

伊丽莎白·里根·比约克（Elizabeth Ligon Bjork）：我是一名心理学教授也是加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校前任学术委员会主席。我的研究兴趣包括视觉注意和发展过程，但现在专注于人类记忆和学习中的实际和理论问题，特别是抑制过程在有效记忆系统中的作用。


罗伯特·比约克（Robert A. Bjork）：我是加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校的教授和心理学主席。我的研究重点是人类的学习和记忆，以及学习科学的教学和培训影响。

**> How did you get interested in studying the facilitating effect of apparent impediments to learning?**

Elizabeth Bjork: My interests in optimizing learning were triggered by interactions with students lamenting during office hours how hard they had studied, only then to perform poorly on a just-given exam. This motivated me to examine why students’ study activities were sometimes so ineffective.

Robert Bjork: My interests go back to my efforts—as a graduate student— to understand the relationship of forgetting and learning, especially why inducing forgetting often enhances subsequent learning. My interests in the application of “desirable difficulties” were fanned by my experiences teaching and coaching and from what I learned as Chair of the National Research Council Committee on Techniques for the Enhancement of Human Performance (1988–1994).



**>你们是如何对研究「表面障碍对学习的促进作用」感兴趣的？**

伊丽莎白·比约克（Elizabeth Bjork）：我在学习优化方面的兴趣是与学生互动引起的，他们感到悲伤，在办公时间内学习很努力，只有在刚刚考试的时候表现不佳。这促使我去研究为什么学生的学习活动有时候是无效的。

罗伯特·比约克（Robert Bjork）：我的兴趣可追溯到我的努力 - 作为研究生 - 了解忘记和学习的关系，特别是为什么遗忘往往会增强后续的学习。我的兴趣在于应用“必要难度理论” 我的教学、指导经验以及作为提高人类表现的国家技术研究委员会主席（1988-1994年）



**> What has been the real-world impact of this work?**

Overall, the impact has been slight. There are multiple indications, however, that the impact of basic research findings on educational practices is increasing and that, in particular, optimizing instruction will require unintuitive innovations in how the conditions of instruction are structured.

**这项工作的实际影响如何？**

总体而言，影响一直很小。然而，有多种迹象表明，基础研究结果对教育实践的影响越来越大，特别是优化教学将需要在教学条件如何结构化方面进行直观的创新。

As teachers—and learners—the two of us have had both a professional and personal interest in identifying the activities that make learning most effective and efficient. What we have discovered, broadly, across our careers in research, is that optimizing learning and instruction often requires going against one’s intuitions, deviating from standard instructional practices, and managing one’s own learning activities in new ways. Somewhat surprisingly, the trials and errors of everyday living and learning do not seem to result in the development of an accurate mental model of the self as learner or an appreciation of the activities that do and do not foster learning.

作为教师和学习者，我们两个人都从专业和个人兴趣来确定使学习最有效和最有效率的活动。我们广泛地发现，在我们的研究生涯中，优化学习和教学往往需要违背自己的直觉，偏离标准教学实践，并以新的方式管理自己的学习活动。有点令人惊讶的是，日常生活和学习的试验和错误似乎并没有导致发展作为学习者的自我准确的精神模式，或者对促进学习的活动的欣赏。



The basic problem learners confront is that we can easily be misled as to whether we are learning effectively and have or have not achieved a level of learning and comprehension that will support our subsequent access to information or skills we are trying to learn. We can be misled by our subjective impressions. Rereading a chapter a second time, for example, can provide a sense of familiarity or perceptual fluency that we interpret as understanding or comprehension, but may actually be a product of low-level perceptual priming. Similarly, information coming readily to mind can be interpreted as evidence of learning, but could instead be a product of cues that are present in the study situation, but that are unlikely to be present at a later time. We can also be misled by our current performance. Conditions of learning that make performance improve rapidly often fail to support long-term retention and transfer, whereas conditions that create challenges and slow the rate of apparent learning often optimize long-term retention and transfer.


学习者面对的基础问题是，我们很容易被误导我们是否在有效学习，有或没有达到一定程度的学习理解将支持我们随后获得我们正在尝试学习的信息或技能。

我们会被主观印象所误导。例如，一个章节将其重读一遍即可很容易地提高学习者对它的熟悉性或知觉流畅性，而学习者往往会将这种熟悉性或流畅性看作是“理解”或“领会”。事实上，相对于真正掌握，重读一遍带来的仅是低水平的知觉启动。

同样，容易想到的信息可以解释为学习的证据，但可以反而成为在研究情境中存在的线索的产物，但不太可能在以后出现。我们也可能被我们目前的表现所误导。使绩效迅速提高的学习条件往往不能支持长期保留和转移，而创造挑战和减缓表观学习速度的条件往往优化长期保留和转移。


### Learning versus Performance

### 学习与表现


This apparent paradox is a new twist on an old and time-honored distinction in psychology—namely, the distinction between learning and performance. Performance is what we can observe and measure during instruction or training. Learning—that is, the more or less permanent change in knowledge or understanding that is the target of instruction—is something we must try to infer, and current performance can be a highly unreliable index of whether learning has occurred.

这个明显的悖论是对心理学中老旧的和历史悠久的区别 - 即学习与表现之间的区别的新转折。表现是我​​们在指导或培训期间可以观察和测量的。学习 - 也就是说，作为教学目标的知识或理解的或多或少永久的变化是我们必须尝试推断的，而现在的表现可能是学习发生的高度不可靠的指标。


**Learning Without Performance and Performance Without Learning**

**没有表现的学习和没有学习的表现**

Decades ago, learning theorists were forced to distinguish between learning and performance because experiments revealed that considerable learning could happen across a period when no change was apparent in performance. In latent-learning experiments with animals, for example, periods of free exploration of a maze, during which the animal’s behavior seemed aimless, were shown—once reward was introduced—to have produced considerable learning. Similarly, in research on motor skills, investigators found that learning continued across trials during which the build-up of fatigue suppressed performance.

几十年前，学习理论家被迫区分学习和表现，因为实验显示，在一段时间内可能会发生相当多的学习，而在表演中没有任何变化。在动物的潜在学习实验中，例如，自由探索迷宫的时期，在此期间，动物的行为看起来毫无目的，表明--一旦引入奖励--产生了大量的学习。同样的，在研究运动技能方面，调查人员发现，学习过程在试验中不断的持续，在此期间，疲劳的积聚会抑制运动。


More recently, a variety of experiments—some of which we summarize below—have demonstrated that the converse is true as well: Namely, substantial improvements in performance across practice or training sessions can occur without significant learning (as revealed after a delay or in another context). To the extent, therefore, that people interpret current performance as a valid measure of learning, they become susceptible to misassessing whether learning has or has not occurred.

最近，我们在下面总结的一些实验 - 已经证明了这一点是正确的：即，在实践或培训课程之间，性能的实质性改善可以在没有重要的学习的情况下发生（如延迟或另一个之后显示的）上下文）。因此，在某种程度上，人们将目前的表现理解为有效的学习措施，他们容易被滥用，无论学习是否已经发生。
